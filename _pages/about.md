👋 Welcome! This is Wang Xia (夏旺), a Ph.D student in Zhejiang University of Technology. 
I joined the Data Visualization Group at Zhejiang University of Technology (ZjutVis) 
in 2019 and under the supervision of [Prof. Ronghua Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fbvnBG4AAAAJ&hl=en) 
and [Prof. Guodao Sun](https://godoorsun.org/). 
My research interests are **interactive machine learning**, **image/video analysis**, and **information visualization**. 
😊 Please feel free to look around and contact me if you have any comments!
